# My-Bash-scripts
Scripts I personally created because I'm really lazy to type out some stuff

Tools and Descriptions

Move and go : Moves a certain file and navigates to that directory(more info with --help)

QCK(Must have nmap installed) :  Preset nmap scan with either UDP or TCP

Scripter : Makes something a script / -u for user or -a for All/everyone  (I know I'm that lazy)
