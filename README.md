# My-Bash-scripts
Scripts I personally created because I'm really lazy to type out some stuff

Tools and Descriptions
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Move and go : Moves a certain file and navigates to that directory(more info with --help)

QCK(Must have nmap installed) :  Preset nmap scan with either UDP or TCP

Scripter : Makes something a script / -u for user or -a for All/everyone  (I know I'm that lazy)

goster : In order to run this script you need
<br /> 1.GoLang installed
<br /> 2.Have gobuster in you binary folder in go
<br /> 3.Have your path variable contain the directory gobuster is located in 


-This script was created to directorybust because I run it so much for hackthebox
-You can modify the wordlist if you change the -w "whatever/wordlist/directory"  t 150" 
in the script or you can just straight up change the whole gobuster command on line 9    :)
